### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brazilian developer living abroad ðŸ˜„  I've moved from the sunny Fortaleza to cold KrakÃ³w and now I'm based in London. I've been working specifically with Javascript for 17 years, but I also wrote few things in Java and other languages.

I like to research about user experience and understand their behaviour while interacting with the apps I help to build.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: as a Brazilian I like football (each country I've lived I choosed the wrong team, always relegated) and water sports. Living in Europe gave me the opportunity to travel to different countries and keep learning with all of cultural differences.
