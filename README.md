### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brazilian developer living abroad ðŸ˜„  I've moved from the sunny Fortaleza to cold KrakÃ³w and now I'm based in London. I've been working specifically with Javascript for 13 years, but I also wrote few things in Java and other languages.

I like to research about user experience and understand their behaviour while interacting with the apps I create.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on customer facing web apps and solutions with Identity Server for Shell Energy Retail.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about streaming process (Kafka, Spark), forecasting and data analysis. GoLang is something new that I'm trying to learn and functional programming is also another thing that I'm looking during my free time.

- âš¡ Fun fact: as a Brazilian I like football (each country I've lived I choosed the wrong team, always relegated) and water sports. Living in Europe gives opportunity to lear about new cultures, travel to different countries and keep learning with all of these differences.
